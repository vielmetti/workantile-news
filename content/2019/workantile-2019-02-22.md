### FoolMoon Luminary Building

After Social Lunch, the FoolMoon people came in to talk to us about the upcoming luminary workshops. 
We have hosted these workshops for the last 7 (?) years, and they are lot of fun - very family friendly. 
The workshops will be every Sunday in March, noon - 5pm. (via Tom)
