## Town Hall notes from 13 Feb 2019

Our scheduled Town Hall for Wednesday, February 13 was
also a snow day for the Ann Arbor schools. About a dozen
people braved the ice and snow, and we had delicious
food from Ahmo's (falafel and a green salad).

The next Town Hall will be scheduled for Wednesday,
March $DATE.
