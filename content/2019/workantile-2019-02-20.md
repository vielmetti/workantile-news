## Town Hall notes from 13 Feb 2019

Our scheduled Town Hall for Wednesday, February 13 was
also a snow day for the Ann Arbor schools. About a dozen
people braved the ice and snow, and we had delicious
food from Ahmo's (falafel and a green salad).

Tom talked through the current state of Workantile
membership and finances. He notes that we are
essentially at break-even. A year ago we had
69 members - 39 full, 23 affiliate, and 7 supporting.
This year at the same time we have 37 full, 19 
affiliate, and 6 supporting. Our shared goal is to pick
up three more full members.

Plans to convert the organization from an LLC to a 501(c)3
are stalled pending membership numbers, and pending positive
changes to cash flow to allow the organization to pay off the
last of its debts.

We discussed a variety of marketing strategies
and tactics to help with the membership roll,
including making an extra effort to be welcoming
to people during their trial days, and outreach
to news media regarding the Workantile tenth
anniversary in June.

The next Town Hall will be scheduled for a Wednesday
in March, with the exact date to be determined.

Thanks to Claire for scheduling and rescheduling
the food delivery, and to Tom for running the meeting.

## Fun!

Wonderfool Productions will be running workshops to
build luminaries for Festifools and Fool Moon again 
this year. We are sorting out details.

## "Conquer the Cold" victory

Workantile was the winner of the Get Downtown
"Conquer the Cold" challenge for large organizations
(51-100 members). We logged 236.8 miles of qualifying
commutes, totalling 142 trips, and saw 15.7% of
members participating. 

For our troubles, all participants
got certificates for drinks at Sweetwaters. Sam
was randomly selected to win a $20 Sava's gift card 
for his winter commute related haiku posted to Twitter.

The next challenge is the "Commuter Challenge" in May,
which follows the same general format of logging
your commute choices.

## From the Internet War Room channel

If you run into issues with the `Workantile`
access point, use the `Workantile 2G` SSID
and notify the `#internet-war-room` channel.
Rebooting the loft access point 5 Ghz radio
causes it to auto-select a channel, which allows
it to switch channels if there is congestion.
