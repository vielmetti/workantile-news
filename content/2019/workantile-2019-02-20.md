## Town Hall notes from 13 Feb 2019

Our scheduled Town Hall for Wednesday, February 13 was
also a snow day for the Ann Arbor schools. About a dozen
people braved the ice and snow, and we had delicious
food from Ahmo's (falafel and a green salad).

The next Town Hall will be scheduled for Wednesday,
March TBD.

Thanks to Claire for scheduling and rescheduling
the food deliver, and to Tom for running the meeting.

## Upcoming events

* Board game night: Feb 21
* Town Hall: March TBD
* Craft night? TBD

## Fun!

Wonderfool Productions will be running workshops to
build luminaries for Festifools and Fool Moon again 
this year.
